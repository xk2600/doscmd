# doscmd for FreeBSD

This has long lost it's ability to function, however I do want the ability to fix this at some point so I ma retaining it for that purpose alone. The problem was it require access to an opaque structure in the kernel, and the ability to read page 0.

This is no longer allowed due to security concerns.

This was the codebase used as the BIOS implementation for bhyve.
